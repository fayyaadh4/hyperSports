# hyperSports Online Sports Store

### Description
This is an online store created using **HTML** for the *structure*, **CSS** for the *design* and **Bootsrap** for the *layout* and then **Javascript** and **JQuery** for the *functionality*.
The store features an index page, about page, catalogue page, a cart and a contacts page. **JSON** was  also used in this website. This project was added to *boost my brand* and to 
*familiarise* me with **gitHub** and **Git**.

### Installation section
The code in this project can be run with any code editor. Visual Studio Code was used to program all the code.

### Usage
The code can be viewed in any browser through an internet connection.
The cart works by adding products on the catalogue page and then proceeding to pay for it on the cart page.
The cart page has a form which allows for a promo code to be inserted which will give a discount. It also provides
a radio selection where delivery or collection options are given. Selecting delivery will add an extra R100 delivery fee.
VAT is also added to the total of the products. The final total is then added and the user is alerted and given a reference number when 
confirming their order.

The site also features styling and animations to make it standout.

### Credits
This project was completed by **Fayyaadh Naidoo** as a project for a *Web Development Bootcamp* in 2020.
