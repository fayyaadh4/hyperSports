He started as a young boy selling whatever sports equipment people would be interested in, out of his backyard. He then decided to grow his business and what better way than to go online. This was the best decision he has ever made. Through the internet, his company has managed to span all across the globe, reaching far and wide. However, he still remains <i>humbled</i> by this, and for that reason he has not become a sell-out and still believes that the <i>customers satisfaction</i> is top priority. He aso encourages customers to email him directly if they have any needs or just want to talk.</p>
